A Collection of Autonomous Driving Tutorials in CARLA Simulator.

<!--more--> 

## Introduction

After getting familiar with CARLA API and Scenario Runner for autonomous driving challenge, I plan to write a series of autonomous driving algorithms in CARLA Simulator, including control, perception, localization, prediction & planning. 

For each advanced topic, I will create separate posts with detailed information. This page will serve as a hub, providing links to each specific topic for navigation purposes.

## Example 07: 3D Bounding Boxes

This example is available in the official CARLA [Tutorials](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.14/tuto_G_bounding_boxes/).
